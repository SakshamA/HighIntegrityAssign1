
Before building the code, we first broke down the requirements into low-level blocks to ensure that we have the same, correct understanding of the task at hand. 
Subsequently, the following strategies were devised to ensure our code correctly implements the requirements:
	a)	Paired programming was used for challenging tasks, such as including a function to detect ventricle fibrillation. This allowed us to consider encountered ambiguities, make design decisions and discuss how to implement those using Ada. 
	b)	Each task was unit tested by both teammates. GitHub was used to share the code and achieve proper version control. When required, calculations were done manually to make sure that the program was exhibiting the intended behaviour.
	c)	After every unit testing, we merged our code with existing working code and conducted integration testing. Here, we ran the code to check if we had achieved the objective of the task without compromising the objectives of previous tasks.
	d)	When code was written separately, each line would be reviewed by the other team member. Comments were added to lines that were not easily understood, and code blocks were divided into procedures/functions when possible to make it easier to read.
	e)	For every phase, we tested the program for around 7-10 times. To debug the code, we used PUT statements and checked if the conditions that were fulfilled were in line with the output we were getting.
	f)	After completing the program, we conducted system testing, which helped us to find logical inaccuracies that were later resolved.
